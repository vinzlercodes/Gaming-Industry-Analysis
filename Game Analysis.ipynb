Then there was a steady rise in sales with fewer variations in the trend. Then in 2000, the sales picked up even more and the decade of the 2010s saw a sharp and huge rise in video games sales volume. From there, there was a sharp fall in revenue till 2015. From there the sales have been slow but picking up.\n\nD)The publisher with the most games sold is Electronic Arts(1344 Million games sold), followed by Activision then comes Namco Bandai Games, Ubisoft and lastly, Konami Digital Entertainment.\n\nElectronic Arts, Activision and Ubisoft all recieve their maximum sales from North America.
