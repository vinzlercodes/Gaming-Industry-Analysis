-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Requirements for the project
The project has been done in the Jupyter enviroment coded in Python (3.8). All the required packages and libraries have been mentioned in requirement.txt for your referal.

The data file would contain 2 files and one of them will have the 'improved' tag, this dataset consists a modified version of the orignal dataset wherein I have searched for the missing publisher column values.

## Motivation
This project was a part of an evaluation assignment of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The students were to select a dataset, come up with some questions and answer them through data analysis of the dataset, and post their findings through a blogpost. The dataset I chose is present on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings), representing gaming industry information from 1984-2020 in reference to the video-game titles that have been released. The code answer's the following questions:
* Which Genre has become most popular?
* Which Platform has been the most popular to play games on?
* How the Sales Trend for games has been for the past 40 years?
* Publishers with most Global Sales along with which country offers the maximum of these sales?

## Summary
The answers to the above questions and my findings can all be found in my blog post right [here](). Please do refer to it.
